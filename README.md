# FindMe
FindMe is a Google Chrome Extension Which helped me to find me on The Websites i used like LinkedIn , Facebook , Instagram , Codepen and Githup.  Why did I create This Extension? Because Chrome eats a lot of Ram and I open a lot of tabs which I use Which negatively affects the speed of the device and by this way Chrome can't do it any more.  Technologies used.. Html , CSS and Jason.
